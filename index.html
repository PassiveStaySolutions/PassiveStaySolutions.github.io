      <h2>About Daniel</h2>
      <p>Daniel grew up immersed in the construction industry, where he built a strong work ethic and deep respect for quality housing. Those early experiences gave him practical knowledge of the building trades and an appreciation for well-maintained properties.</p>
      <p>After marrying into a family with a rich legacy in the military and healthcare, Daniel saw firsthand the unique challenges faced by traveling healthcare workers, patients, and military personnel. His perspective became deeply personal when his father was diagnosed with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and required a double lung transplant. This journey highlighted the urgent need for safe, reliable housing during times of transition.</p>
      <p>Motivated by this experience, Daniel founded <strong>Passive Stay Solutions LLC</strong> with a mission: to provide housing that supports traveling healthcare professionals, patients, and other mobile workers—while giving property owners peace of mind through responsible, hassle-free partnerships.</p>
